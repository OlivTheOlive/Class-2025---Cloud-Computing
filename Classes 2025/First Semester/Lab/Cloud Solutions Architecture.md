##### **Findings & Analysis**:
###### **Why VNet peering is important**
VNet peering is important becauseÂ it creates a private, high-bandwidth connection between virtual networks, enabling them to function as one by isolating itself from the public network.
###### **How private IP communication was established**
Private IP was created to solve the shortage of public IP addresses.
###### **Benefits of global peering (performance & security)**
- Low latency by shortening the data path
- High level of security because its the peering is isolated from public transit

#### Week 3
Developing a cloud adoption strategy
1. Identify motivations  
	1. Migration
	2. Innovation
2. Document business outcomes  
	1. **Fiscal outcomes:** Financial or fiscal performance is the cleanest business outcome for many business leaders, but not the only one.  
	2. **Agility outcomes:** Today's fast-changing business environment places  a premium on time. The ability to respond to and drive market change quickly is the fundamental measure of business agility.  
	3. **Reach outcomes:** In a constantly shrinking market, global reach (ability to support global customers and users) can be measured by compliance in geographies that are relevant to the business.
3. Financial considerations  
4. Technical considerations 
	1. **Scalability:** Right-sizing resources and utilizing auto-scaling, matching the scalability needs, turning off workloads outside of business hours and scaling only when necessary have the added benefit of driving more sustainable workloads
	2. **Availability:** On-premises, it's more costly to build highly available infrastructure. It's less costly to architect highly available infrastructure in the cloud.
	3. **Security and compliance:** When it comes to security and compliance, Microsoft is continually expanding our security infrastructure and toolsets to keep you on par with what's transpiring with respect to security threats on global networks.
	4. **Capacity optimization:** Capacity optimization, where you only pay for the resources you utilize over time, is another technical benefit of the cloud.
6. Organizational alignment and skills readiness plans  
7. Creating a business case
